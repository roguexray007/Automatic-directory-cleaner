# Automatic-file-cleaner

1.largest_10_files.py --- using this u can get the top ten largest file size within the directory(recursively scan all folders 						     and files within that directory) u specify

2.cleaning.py --- example usage of this script -If there are 10 MP3 files, 3 word documents, 4 PDFs then in Documents Folder 				   three folders should be created with name MP3, DOC and PDF and all the files on the Desktop should be moved                   into these directories based on their file type or extension.
				  
I actually added option of specifying which directory u want to organise and where u want all the files to get organised..
Any file without extension will go into WITHOUT_EXT folder
